# Tech Test FMP

## Task

Write an application that takes numeric input (N) from a user and outputs a multiplication table of (N) prime numbers.

## Instructions

- Build in Javascript
- You should have a test for a performant prime algorithm that can generate a list of primes.
- Have high test coverage. (recommended)
- For the input and output you can use the console, a web page, or something else.
- Write an algorithm to solve the prime number generation. (Do not use a library method)
- You should input a whole number N, where is N is at least 1.
- The application should output an N+1 x N+1 grid of numbers.

## Example for when 3 is given as input

```
| | 2 | 3 | 5 |
| 2 | 4 | 6 | 10 |
| 3 | 6 | 9 | 15 |
| 5 | 10 | 15 | 25 |
```
